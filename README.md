Hi there!

My name is Achraf and I'm a JAMStack developer who loves to work with modern web technologies such as React, Redux, and Typescript.

I started my journey as a self-taught web developer right out of High School when I first got fascinated by the web development world and wanted to build amazing progressive web apps. Ever since I have fallen in love with web development and spend most of my days taking my skills to the next-level.
